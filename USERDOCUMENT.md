The design of the website: 
I tried to design the website basing on my protoype website that I made in canva, but I couldn't 
entirely recreate it so I tried designing it as close as it can be. 

The design of website was supposed to be a 'modern' type of design wherein the card would be transparent and clickable links that looks appealing to the eyes to click. 

I also chose a 'midnight' purple color as the main color of this website as it looks pretty aesthetic in my eyes.


I had many troubles trying to code this website into fruitiion but with hardwork and dedication I was finally able to finish this website. I took around 10 hours the past few days just to finish the website, fixing many errors that I have encountered along the way. Though it was hard and grueling task, I have learned many things about coding. That there are 'parent' and 'children' codes that are very important when trying to adjust the position of an image or the item itself. 

I was able to set this website up with the help of Bootstrap v5.3.0 and youtube, watching the videos of other coding experts had helped me build what I was envisioning for the website. the documents in the bootstrap website had helped me the most.
